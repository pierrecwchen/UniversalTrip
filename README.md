# UniversalTrip

The program was created for graphic class in 2011 with visual studio 2010 under windows 7. Users controll a spaceship(sphere) travelling in unknown universe. The ship contains a spot light in front of it, two kinds (normal and wide) view, and speed control. Moreover, it provides 4 kinds (first person/third person/back shoulder/god) camera views. It demonstrates a little bit my knowledge of camera, collision, vertex/fragment shaders, lights, and so on.

Controls and default settings:


Press:

"up" and "down" to increase and decrease speed of spaceship,

"F1" for first person view, "F2" for third person view,

"F3" for back shoulder view, "F4" for god view,

"s" for super speed,

"z" and "x" for normal and wide view,

"h" for stop the spaceship,

"q" or "esc" to exit program,

And move mouse to rotate the spaceship.

Notice: the rotation of left and right will be narrowed as the rotation of up and down is more near to up or down.


By default:

Number of planets = 900 with max = 10 and min = 1,

First person view,

Spaceship initially placed in (0, 0, 0) and look at (0, 0, 0.005),

Wide view mode,

Spotlight source at (0, 0, 0.002).
